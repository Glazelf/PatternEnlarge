# PatternEnlarge
Script to enlarge patterns programmatically as if they were a pattern. I couldn't find a solid, free way to do this online so decided to make it myself.

## Usage
Run `npm install`.  
Run `node .`.  
Supply filename when asked, including extension.  
Pray it works.  


## How it works
This script will:
1. Copy your file to a canvas.
2. Enlarge said canvas by 100% in both axis.
3. Paste copies of the image on the 3 empty "slots".
4. Save the new image to a file.
